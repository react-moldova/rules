# Rules

## i. Basics

- Do not spam.
- If you are going to post code, please make sure it's formatted by [prettier](https://prettier.io/).
- Be respectful.
- Animated gifs are fun, and often entertaining and we all (mostly) enjoy them... at first. People like to enjoy the gif once, maybe twice, but over and over until the conversation pushes it off screen is annoying.

## ii. Etiquette

- We cannot allow community to go on in a single unified language, so **we're romanian, russian and english friendly community**.
- Don't start your conversation just with 'Hello', be respectful of others' time.
- There is no need to ask to ask a question.

## iii. Asking for Help 

- It can be every kind of question regarding React.
- It can be even HTML/CSS question, why not, we're front-end developers.
- It can be every issue regarding Typescript or Flowtype.
- Also, it can be even Rollup and Webpack.
